Apparently it is possible to grow herbs indoors.  I even saw some people were growing potatoes in plastic bags filled with dirt hanging from their apartment balcony.

So I looked up plants and found out herbs are pretty easy to grow.

Also there are two types, perennials and annuals, the annuals have to be pollinated and replanted every year whereas the perennials just grow indefinitely.

Decided on already grown herbs since I am a beginner and it is harder to grow from seed.

I bought two planters, a marjoram plant, garlic chives, celery leaf, and sage.

First step was removing the plastic containers that the herbs were in, putting them in the planters, and filling the planters with dirt.
