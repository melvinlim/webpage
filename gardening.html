Apparently it is possible to grow herbs indoors.  I even saw some people were growing potatoes in plastic bags filled with dirt hanging from their apartment balcony.<br>
So I looked up plants and found out herbs are pretty easy to grow.<br>
Also there are two types, perennials and annuals, the annuals have to be pollinated and replanted every year whereas the perennials just grow indefinitely.<br>
Decided on already grown herbs since I am a beginner and it is harder to grow from seed.<br>
I bought two planters, a marjoram plant, chives, etc...<br>
First step was removing the plastic containers that the herbs were in, putting them in the planters, and filling the planters with dirt.<br>
Now I have some herb plants.<br>
