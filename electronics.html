I had some free time so I decided to learn how to use the AVR microcontrollers.
</p>
<p style="color:white">
I purchased an atmega328p microcontroller.
</p>
<p style="color:white">
First I stripped a parallel port cable then I labelled every single wire through trial and error using inb outb commands on linux.
</p>
<p style="color:white">
Eventually I connected the wires to the AVR and used the avrdude program to try and program it.
</p>
<p style="color:white">
Anyway it failed.  So I gave up for a few weeks.

Later when I tried again I purchased a usbasp programmer.  I again hooked it up and tried to program it and failed.

Next I remembered I had a Raspberry PI computer lying around.  Raspberry PI has a bunch of pins that you can use to send output and someone wrote a guide how to do that also avrdude supports this only you have to edit the avrdude.conf file to specify the particular ports you are using.

Anyway it didn't work but in the end I realized I needed a crystal since the AVR chip had been modified to use a crystal for some reason.
</p>
<p style="color:white">
So the moral of the story is to connect a crystal to the AVR before programming it if you are doing this without an Arduino.
