To change the time without typing an entire string: (Couldn't find this easily on the manpages or internet.)<br>
<input value="date -s '+1 hour'" type="text" readonly><br>
This would advance the time by one hour, -1 hour or -1 minute or whatever probably works too.<br>
<br>
To find a string of text in a bunch of files:<br>
<input value="grep -lr string *" type="text" readonly><br>
This will search all files in the current directory and all subdirectories and return the names of files containing string, where string may be a regular expression.<br>
