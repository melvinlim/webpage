Saw project at <a href="http://www.htpc-diy.com/2012/04/diy-flexible-fractal-window-hdtv.html">HTPGDIY</a> and tried to duplicate it.<br>
Noticed it was a variation of the wire version at <a href="http://www.ruckman.net/downloads/fractaltemplate.pdf">ruckman.net</a>.<br>
Decided to use <a href="https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B5qwfAJxZVWKOEwxNkZINFhZS28">foil version</a> since I have no spare 10awg wire.<br>
Printed out the PDF file on A6 (8 inch by 11 inch) paper and measured to confirm 1 inch long smaller segments and 4 inch long larger segments.<br>
Glued tinfoil on back of paper and cut designs out with sharp scissors.  (Dull razor blade would tear the paper)<br>
Glued designs to a piece of plastic cut out from old plastic packaging.  Separated designs by 1/4 of an inch.<br>
Attached matching transformer (Balun) from <a href="http://www.thesource.ca/estore/product.aspx?product=1509140">TheSource</a> to plastic design at the rounded ends using nuts and bolts.<br>
Connected to coax and it worked!  (Unfortunately only received one channel, CBUT-DT (UHF 43) reliably)<br>
